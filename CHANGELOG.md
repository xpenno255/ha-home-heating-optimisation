# Changelog

## 0.3.0 — read-only house survey

- Optional house.yaml and room-file loading with explicit thermostat mappings.
- Thermal/layout context in reports: dimensions, boundaries, neighbours, openings, construction U-values and radiator ratings.
- Preserved confidence labels, survey revision and validation warnings.
- House model status, standalone report and reload actions.
- Address, network, photo and occupancy-routine fields excluded from evidence.
- Survey changes preserve measured history; source files are never written.

## 0.2.0 — historical analytics

- Optional shared history, background Recorder backfill and bounded private storage.
- Coverage-gated comfort/demand metrics, observed recoveries and matched comparisons.
- Daily comparison, adjustment journal and structured report actions.
- Optional OT/boiler decision context, isolated from measured comfort metrics.
- Corrected selected-demand activity, independent expiry and Recorder boundary handling.
- Prior source era retained; corrupt/unsupported history preserved without overwrite.
- Legacy engine parity on 12,061 observations, nine rooms and four window sizes.

This version remains observation-only and makes no AI calls.

## 0.1.0 — observation foundation

- One setup/options flow for room and optional boiler/system sources.
- Shared timestamped observations with unit conversion and explicit source quality.
- Room temperature, commanded target, demand and positive-deficit sensors.
- Actual flow/return, flow-setpoint readback, heating/DHW and input diagnostics.
- Timed source expiry, event updates, unload cleanup and retained room identities.
- Quality-only downloadable diagnostics and deterministic manual-install ZIP.
- Implementation inventory, migration/handover design and future AI-profile architecture.

This development version has no control writes, legacy imports, history analytics
or AI calls. Existing integrations remain the controllers.
